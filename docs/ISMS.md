# Information Security Management System (ISMS)

## Purpose
Establishes a unified framework to prove compliance with all major data privacy and cybersecurity laws (GDPR, HIPAA, UK GDPR, PIPEDA, Privacy Act 1988, NIS2, CRA, NIST, ACSC) using ISO 27001 as the foundation.

## Scope
Covers all software, data, and personnel involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of SpeedXToolKit.

## Policies & Procedures
### Information Security Policy
SpeedXToolKit is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all information assets. All staff must follow security procedures, report incidents, and participate in regular security training. Management reviews this policy annually.

### Data Privacy Policy
Personal and patient data is processed lawfully, transparently, and only for specified purposes. Data subjects have rights to access, correct, and erase their data. All processing aligns with GDPR, HIPAA, and other applicable laws. Data minimization and pseudonymization are applied where possible.

### Acceptable Use Policy
Employees must use company systems and data only for authorized business purposes. Prohibited activities include unauthorized data access, sharing, or use of personal devices for sensitive data. Violations may result in disciplinary action.

### Access Control Policy
Access to sensitive data is restricted based on job role and business need. All access is logged and reviewed. User accounts are managed with least privilege, and access is revoked promptly when no longer required.

### Data Breach Incident Response Plan
1. Detect and report suspected breaches immediately.
2. Contain and assess the breach.
3. Notify affected parties and authorities as required by law.
4. Investigate root cause and implement corrective actions.
5. Document all actions and review the plan after each incident.

### Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy
All software is developed following secure coding standards, regular code reviews, and automated security testing. Vulnerabilities are tracked and remediated before release. Security requirements are included in all project specifications.
